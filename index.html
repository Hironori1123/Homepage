                    <p>I am a phonologist specializing in the lexicon-phonology interface and phonology in language contact, including loanword phonology and bilingual phonology. I also word as a phonetician, exploring the effects of prosody, 
                        speaking rate, and sociolinguistic factors, on the production and perception of speech sounds. 
                        In summer 2024, I became a Visiting Assistant Professor in phonology at the University of Kansas. 
                        Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto Scarborough with 
                        Professor Yoonjung Kang and earned my Ph.D. in Linguistics at UCLA in 2023, mentored by Professors Bruce Hayes and Sun-Ah Jun.</p>
