                    <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I work under the guidance of Professor Yoonjung Kang. 
                        My research focuses mainly on theoretical and experimental phonology, phonetics, as well as fieldwork. 
                        I completed my PhD studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
                        My dissertation examined the multiple factors that influence the assignment of loanword accents in Japanese.
                        My research employed a multi-faceted approach, including corpus analysis, computational modeling and experiments.</p>
