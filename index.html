                    <p>I am a visiting assistant professor at the University of Kansas. 
                        Prior to this position, I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I worked under the mentorship of Professor Yoonjung Kang. 
                        I earned my Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. 
                        My research interests lie in computational and experimental approaches to phonology, experimental phonetics, and psycholinguistics.
                        I employ a diverse range of research methodologies, including corpus analysis, computational modeling, and experiments.
